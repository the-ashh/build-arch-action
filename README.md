# build-arch-action

this is a essentially single use repo for [the-ashh/ash-patches](https://github.com/the-ashh/ash-patches) which builds these packages for me in github actions. as long as you replace the contents of [this script](https://github.com/the-ashh/build-arch-action/blob/master/entrypoint.sh) with your build script, it should work for whatever needs you may have! if you need an example of a working action \*.yml for this, go check out [the-ashh/ash-patches](https://github.com/the-ashh/ash-patches). ily all <3
